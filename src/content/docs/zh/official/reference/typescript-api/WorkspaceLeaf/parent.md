## WorkspaceLeaf.parent property

The direct parent of the leaf.

On desktop, a leaf is always a child of a `WorkspaceTabs` component. On mobile, a leaf might be a child of a `WorkspaceMobileDrawer`<!-- -->. Perform an `instanceof` check before making an assumption about the `parent`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
parent: WorkspaceTabs | WorkspaceMobileDrawer;
```
